# 👓 Inde13
## 🐍 Python lover

## 🔥 Programming since 2018

Aiming to learn with new and fun projects

## 💻 My projects

Besides Python, my first projects posted on github were made with HTML, CSS and some with a bit of JS.

Nowadays I code mostly in Python and sometimes diversify and have fun with other languages and technologies.

### 💯 Currently working on

I am currently working on a project called "Where is Everybody". A Python Terminal based game with a dramatic and tense story and a touch of hardcore survival.

## 👀 Maybe I can help!

I'm not the most experienced programmer, but I really enjoy helping and collaborating with other people's codes and projects! hmu 😉
